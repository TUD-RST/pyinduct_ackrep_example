# Code from the GMA Talk

This repository contains the python files that were shown in the talk at this
years meeting of the GMA Fachausschuss 1.30. 
It contains the implementation of the well known introductory 
backstepping example 4.1 from [KristicEtAl08].

### Usage

To run the files, `pyinduct` must be installed on your system.
Further information can be found in the files themselves, 
probably `main.py` is the best place to start.
